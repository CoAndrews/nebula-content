// Create three numbers, assign them to variables and subtract the smaller two from the largest

let alpha = 20

// Create two even numbers, assign them to variables and divide one from the other

let delta = 10
let epsilon = 60


// // Check it worked by logging to the console

// Create two odd numbers, assign them to variables and multiply one from the other

let zeta = 11
let theta = 21
// Check it worked by logging to the console

// Create a variable and log it's remainder, if divided by 3, to the console 

let kappa = 9

// Answer in plain text, what is modulo especially useful for?

// remainders of division,  finding out reminders of odd numbers that arent easily divisible into other whole numbers
