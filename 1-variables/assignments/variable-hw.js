//i used the practice format to style the variables in a more legible way

//1. Create a set of 6 variables that define an animal (age, height, name, etc...). Must be at least 6 variables.
const dogName = "Khaleesi"
const dogBreed = "Pitt Bull"
const dogWeight = "59 pounds"
const dogColor = "Brindle"
const dogEyeColor = "Brown"
const dogBirthYear = "2007"

const myDog = `${dogName} ${dogWeight}
${dogColor}, ${dogBreed}
${dogEyeColor}, ${dogBirthYear}`

console.log(myDog)
//2. Create a set of 6 variables that define a vehicle. Must be at least 6 variables.
const vehicleColor = "Blue"
const vehicleBrand = "Jaguar"
const vehicleNickname = "Lightening"
const vehicleFuel = "Hybrid"
const vehicleSize = "Coupe"
const vehicleWheelDrive = "All-Wheel Drive"

const myVehicle = `${vehicleColor}, ${vehicleNickname} 
${vehicleBrand}, ${vehicleWheelDrive}
${vehicleSize}, ${vehicleFuel}`

console.log(myVehicle)
